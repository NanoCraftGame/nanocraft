          We identified two prospective customers: one in Germany and one in Finland:

          ## New Norsk Energy Oy

          New Norsk Energy is a Finland battery manufacturer of middle size. They
          produce big batteries for industrial equipment and our product can make
          their production cheaper, therefore their primary objective is low price
          however, they don't need a very high purity. They agreed for 14 tons at 
          price €5,000 per ton.

          ## Battarfungën Gmbh.

          Battarfungën Gmbh. is a Berlin-based mobile batteries manufacturer. They 
          see our product as a way to make their batteries lighter, however, their 
          purity requirements are very tight. They agreed to buy **two tons** at a price
          **€17,000 per ton**, however they need **purity of 98%** which we don't really know 
          how to achieve yet, although we have some rough ideas.

          - name: Choose "New Norsk Energy Oy"

                      We identified two high volume pump suppliers:
                      1. **Ornata** is a reseller of Chinese equipment, their pumps cost €3,999 each and can pump
                         up to 200 liters/hour
                      2. **Iveco** is an Italian industrial equipment manufacturer they can supply us pumps for 
                         €4,300, however they don't provide shipment options, so we have to find also a shipping company.
                         Their pumps can pump up to 250 liters/hour and seem to be more reliable.
